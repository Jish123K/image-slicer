#Image parser

An image parser in Python is a program that analyzes an image file and extracts relevant information from it. This process typically involves converting the image data into a format that can be easily manipulated by the computer, such as an array of pixel values.

Python provides a range of libraries that can be used to parse images, including PIL (Python Imaging Library), OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), and scikit-image. These libraries offer various functions for loading, manipulating, and analyzing images, such as resizing, cropping, filtering, and segmentation.

Using an image parser in Python, one can perform various tasks such as object recognition, face detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and even creating a deep learning model to classify images. These parsers are commonly used in industries like healthcare, retail, and surveillance for automating the image analysis process.
